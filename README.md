# Shopify Backend Challenge 2022
The purpose of this challenge was to build out the backend of an inventory tracking application for a logistics company. The application is accessible at:
### https://shopify-backend-2022.herokuapp.com/

## Running the application
To make evaluating the application simpler, the server is hosted on Heroku and can be accessed over the web at the URL specified above. No installations or packages
are required to be installed for the evaluators. I utilized Postman to send requests to the application's API endpoints (described in detail below). The application can 
also be accessed using the 'curl' command from the terminal of your machine, however, only the process for using Postman is described below.
