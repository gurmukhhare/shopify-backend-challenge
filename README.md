# Shopify Backend Challenge 2022
The purpose of this challenge was to build out the backend of an inventory tracking application for a logistics company. The challenge requirements are documented at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z9LZ_kZBUbg-O2MhZVVSqTmvDko5IJWHtuFmIu_Xg1A/edit. My application is accessible at:
### https://shopify-backend-2022.herokuapp.com/

## Running the application
To make evaluating the application simpler, the server is hosted on Heroku and can be accessed over the web at the URL specified above. No installations or packages
are required for the evaluators. I utilized Postman to send requests to the application's API endpoints (described in detail below). The application can also be accessed via HTTP requests using the 'curl' command from the terminal of your machine. Because I used Postman, this documentation is tailored accordingly.

## API Documentation
Before getting into the details of the API, it is important to mention that the extra feature I have chosen to implement is the 'ability to create warehouses/locations and assign inventory to specific locations'. The corresponding API for this feature are also listed below.

| Endpoint | HTTP verb | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| /inventory/items/:itemId? | GET | Retrieve all items currently stored in the inventory. If optional parameter 'itemId' provided, retrieve that specific item |
| /inventory/items | POST | Create new inventory item |
